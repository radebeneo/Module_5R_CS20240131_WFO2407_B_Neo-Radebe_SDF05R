This project demonstrates how to apply custom styles and animations to buttons using HTML and CSS. The goal is to create visually appealing buttons that respond to user interactions with smooth animations.


1. **Button 1 - Shake Animation**:
- Design Choice: A gradient background with a horizontal shake effect to grab the user's attention
- The shake animation is simple yet effective in creating a playful interaction.

2. **Button 2 - Shrink and Grow Animation**:
- Design Choice: A gradient background with a shrink and grow effect to create a dynamic feel.
- The shrink and grow animations provide a visually appealing effect, making the button interaction more engaging.

3. **Button 3 - Rotate Animation**:
- Design Choice: A gradient background with a 360-degree rotation to create a striking visual effect.
- The rotation effect is attention-grabbing and provides a unique interaction for the user.


**Challenges**
- Ensuring Smooth Animations: One challenge was to ensure that the animations were smooth. Fine-tuning the keyframes and animation durations was key to achieving this.

**Features**
- Chained Animations: The chained animations on Button 2 were particularly satisfying to implement. They add a level of sophistication and responsiveness to the button interactions.
- Gradient Backgrounds: The use of gradient backgrounds adds a modern and visually appealing touch to the buttons, enhancing their aesthetic appeal.
